# Dockerized RabbitMQ messaging system producer/consumer example


## Installation

Set the environment variable RABBIT_HOST_IP. This should be the host IP you get using e.g. ifconfig.

    $ export RABBIT_HOST_IP=<your host IP - not localhost or 127.0.0.1>  

Start container

    $ docker-compose up  
    
If your environment variable is set incorrectly, you'll get something like

    $ pika.exceptions.AMQPConnectionError: Connection to 127.0.0.1:5672 failed: [Errno 111] Connection refused
